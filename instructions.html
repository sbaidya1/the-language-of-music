	<ol>
		<li>Click the “play” button on the home page (bottom right) to navigate to the song input page</li>
		<li>Input the title and artist of the song you’d like to do the exercise with OR enter a play code given to you by your teacher<br>
		<ul><li>When a song is inputted, the site is doing something similar to a Google search for the Genius lyrics. Thus, the more accurately the song is inputted, the more likely it is for the site to receive the correct lyrics/video.</li></ul>
		<li>Wait for the lyrics and YouTube video to load<br>
		<ul><li>Depending on the wifi and the number of people using the site, this may take a few seconds to load. Do not panic if the site is blank at first!</li></ul></li>
		<li>Set your preferences by clicking on the settings icon above the YouTube video. If you are using a play code, this feature may be disabled by your teacher.</li>
		<li>Fill out the survey after playing</li>
	</ol>
	<p id="end">Lyrics are powered by Genius’s database. If your inputted song is not found, check if Genius has the lyrics. For lesser known songs, it is possible that Genius has inaccurate lyrics or does not have the lyrics at all.<br><br>
	Sometimes vocables/vocalizations like “la” or “ah” are counted as lyrics. If this happens, feel free to skip that line/word or use *** to reveal the word.</p>
